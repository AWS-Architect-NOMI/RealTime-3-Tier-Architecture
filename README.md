# RealTime-3-Tier-Architecture
Comprehensive Analysis of AWS Architecture Diagram Using AWS Well-Architected Framework
Introduction

This blog provides an in-depth analysis of an AWS-based architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF). It explains each component, how it aligns with AWS best practices.

Architecture Overview

The architecture includes multiple AWS services arranged in a 3-tier setup with enhanced security, scalability, and performance.

1. Web Tier

Route 53: DNS service directing traffic to the application.

Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes HTTPS traffic across two Windows 2016 Web Servers.

TLS 1.2 / 1.3 Encryption: Secure HTTPS communication.

SignalR WebSockets: Supports real-time client-server communication.

2. Application Tier

Network Load Balancer (NLB): Distributes HTTPS traffic to backend application servers.

EC2 Instances (Windows 2016 Data Management Servers): Application logic processing with specific ports (443, 52508).

3. Data Tier

Amazon Aurora (Primary & Failover Replica): High availability and automatic failover.

VPC with 10.0.0.0/16: Segmented network with subnets for each tier.

4. Security & Compliance

AWS WAF: Protects against common exploits.

AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector: Provides continuous monitoring.

IAM Roles, ABAC, RBAC: Granular access control.

Amazon S3 with Encryption at Rest: Stores static content securely.

AWS SNS & Email Notifications: Alerts for security breaches.

Mapping to AWS Well-Architected Framework

1. Operational Excellence

Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch & SNS: Proactive alerts on infrastructure.

CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline: Automates deployment.

2. Security

IAM Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures least privilege access.

AWS Security Hub & GuardDuty: Detects threats in real-time.

TLS 1.2 / 1.3 & Encryption at Rest: Data protection measures.

3. Reliability

Multi-AZ Aurora Database: Automatic failover protection.

Auto Scaling for EC2 Instances: Ensures resilience under load.

Multi-AZ Load Balancing: Increases fault tolerance.

4. Performance Efficiency

Amazon Aurora vs. RDS: Optimized query execution.

NLB vs. ALB: Suitable load balancer selection.

Use of WebSockets (SignalR): Reduces API call overhead.

5. Cost Optimization

Auto Scaling Policies: Prevents over-provisioning.

S3 for Static Resources: Reduces compute costs.

AWS Savings Plans & Spot Instances: Optimizes pricing model.

6. Sustainability

AWSâ€™s Carbon Reduction Initiatives: Uses energy-efficient services.

Serverless Considerations: Reduces idle compute power.
